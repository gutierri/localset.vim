localset.vim

localset.vim is a simple, minimalist plugin that sets (project) local settings
looking for a vim.local at the root of $VIM_PROJECT

configuration:

set a variable envirion with the name of the project root folder on shell

$ export VIM_PROJECT=localset.vim

now every time you are editing a file inside this folder, localset.vim
automatically updates looking for a file with settings in 
$VIM_PROJECT/vim.local
